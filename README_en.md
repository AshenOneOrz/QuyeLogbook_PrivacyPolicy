# **Privacy Policy of GoWild**

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Effective Date:** 2026-02-10
**App Name:** GoWild
**Developer:** Dong Chen

This Privacy Policy explains how GoWild (hereinafter referred to as “the App”) handles user information during the provision of its services. The App is designed with **offline use and local storage** as its core principles and **does not collect, upload, or share** any personal information.

---

## **1. What Information Do We Collect?**

**We do not collect any personal information.**

* We do not collect identity information such as name, phone number, email address, or ID numbers
* We do not collect location data, contacts, SMS, or call logs
* We do not collect device identifiers (such as IDFA or IDFV) or advertising data
* We do not collect app usage data, analytics, or crash reports (unless you explicitly choose to share them with Apple or third parties at the system level)
* We do not collect any data you enter into the App, including logs, photos, gear information, or settings

---

## **2. Data Storage and Processing**

GoWild is an **offline-first app**. All data is processed and stored locally on your device only, including but not limited to:

* Trip logs, weather, distance, elevation gain, and notes
* Gear library data such as categories, brands, weights, and prices
* Photos you choose to add and exported shareable images
* App settings such as language, theme, and currency

**We do not operate any servers**, and therefore none of the above data is uploaded to the cloud or transmitted to any third party.

---

## **3. Network Access**

All core features of the App work without an internet connection.

If future versions introduce optional online features (such as synchronization or backup), we will:

* Clearly inform you before enabling such features
* Specify the types of data involved and their purposes
* Process such data only after you explicitly authorize or enable the feature

---

## **4. Permissions**

To support certain features, the App may request system permissions. Granting or denying permissions is entirely up to you, and denying a permission will not affect unrelated features.

Possible permissions (depending on your enabled features) include:

* **Photo Library (Add/Save):** Used to save generated share images to your photo library when you tap “Save to Photos”
* **Photo Access (Read):** Used to select trip photos from your photo library when you choose to add photos

We do not upload or analyze your photo library content.

---

## **5. Third-Party SDKs and Data Sharing**

**The App does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs**, and does not share your data with any third party.

---

## **6. Children’s Privacy**

The App is not specifically designed for children and does not collect any personal information. If a parent or guardian believes that a child’s data may have been improperly processed while using the App, please contact us and we will address the issue promptly.

---

## **7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

If this Privacy Policy is updated, we will notify you within the App or in the release notes and update the “Last Updated” date. Continued use of the App after the changes take effect means you acknowledge and agree to the updated policy.
