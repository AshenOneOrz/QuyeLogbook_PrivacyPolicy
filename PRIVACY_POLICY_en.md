# “Go Wild Logbook” Privacy Policy

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-10
**Effective Date**: 2026-02-10
**App Name**: Go Wild Logbook
**Developer**: Chen Dong

This Privacy Policy explains how “Go Wild Logbook” (hereinafter referred to as “the App”) handles user information while providing services. The App is designed with “offline use and local storage” as its core principle and **does not collect, upload, or share** users’ personal information.

---

## 1. What information do we collect?

**We do not collect any personal information.**

* We do not collect identity information such as name, phone number, email address, or ID number.
* We do not collect location information, contacts, SMS, or call logs.
* We do not collect device identifiers (such as IDFA or IDFV) or advertising data.
* We do not collect app usage data, analytics events, or crash reports (unless you explicitly choose at the system level to share them with Apple or third parties).
* We do not collect any data you enter, including logs, photos, gear information, or settings.

---

## 2. Data storage and processing

The App is an **offline application**. All data is processed and stored locally on your device, including but not limited to:

* Trip logs, weather, distance, elevation gain, and notes
* Gear library, categories, brands, weights, and prices
* Photos you choose to add and exported share images
* App settings such as language, theme, and currency

**We do not have any servers**, therefore none of the above data is uploaded to the cloud or transmitted to third parties.

---

## 3. Network access

The core features of the App can be used offline.

However, to provide “Go Wild Pro” subscription/in-app purchase features, the App requires network access in the following scenarios:

* **Displaying the paywall and initiating purchases**: communicating with Apple App Store payment services.
* **Subscription status verification and entitlement delivery**: communicating with RevenueCat services via the RevenueCat SDK to confirm your purchase status and unlock corresponding entitlements.

Except for the billing-related functions described above, the App does not upload your trip logs, gear library, photos, or settings to any server.

If future versions introduce additional optional online features (such as sync or backup), we will:

* Clearly inform you before enabling such features
* Separately specify what types of data will be processed and for what purpose
* Only process such data after you actively authorize or enable the feature

---

## 4. Permission usage

To provide certain features, the App may request system permissions. Whether to grant these permissions is entirely up to you, and denying them will not affect other unrelated features.

Possible permissions (depending on the features you enable) include:

* **Photo Library (add/save)**: used to save shared images to your system photo library (triggered when you tap “Save to Photos”)
* **Photo access (read)**: used to select trip photos from your photo library (triggered only when you actively choose photos)

We do not upload your photo library content or use it for any analysis.

---

## 5. Third-party SDKs and data sharing

The App does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.

However, to enable subscription and in-app purchase features, the App integrates the **RevenueCat SDK** for subscription status verification and entitlement unlocking, and uses the **Apple App Store** to process payments.

When making purchases, restoring purchases, or refreshing subscription status, the App communicates with RevenueCat and Apple services. To complete transaction verification and entitlement determination, necessary information may be processed or transmitted (typically including but not limited to: product identifiers, receipt information / purchase tokens, and subscription status-related information).

We do not proactively upload your trip logs, gear library, photos, notes, or settings to RevenueCat or any other third party.

---

## 6. Children’s privacy

The App is not specifically intended for children and does not collect any personal information. If a guardian believes that a child may be exposed to improper data handling risks while using the App, they may contact us to address the issue.

---

## 7. Updates to this Privacy Policy

If this Privacy Policy is updated, we will notify you within the App or in release notes and update the “Last Updated” date accordingly. Continued use of the App after the changes take effect indicates that you understand and agree to the updated policy.
